### Automation tools

|      | CodeBuild                                       | GitLab CI                                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pros | AWS integration                                 | GitLab integration: allows keeping code managenent and CI in the same place |
|      | Integrates with other AWS services              | Supports a wide range of build environments and tools                       |
|      | Simple declarative language (buildspec.yml)     | Uses simple and flexible .gitlab-ci.yml configuration                       |
|      |                                                 | Parallelism: easy config jobs that can be run in parallel                   |
|      |                                                 | Distributed builds: tasks can be scaled on multiple machines                |
| Cons | Limited to AWS environments and tools           | Self-hosting or using GitLab's cloud offering                               |
|      | More expensive than self-hosted solutions       | Can be difficult to set up and configure                                    |
|      | Requires knowledge of AWS-specific technologies | Limited integration with non-GitLab tools and services                      |

| **Benefits**   | Provides an easy way to define and manage complex AWS infrastructures                         | Provides a convenient way to express infrastructure as code than traditional YAML or JSON templates     | Supports modularization and reuse of code through modules and modules sources                                         |
|                | Enables automatic and repeatable provisioning and deployment of infrastructure resources      | Can be used with existing code and tooling in a variety of programming languages                        | Provides a plan command that allows for previewing the changes before applying them to the infrastructure             |
|                |                                                                                               | Enables the use of AWS constructs and abstractions to simplify the creation of infrastructure resources | Provides a wide range of third-party modules that can be used to extend its functionality                             |
| **Challenges** |                                                                                               | Steep learning curve                                                                                    | Steep learning curve                                                                                                  |
|                | Can be difficult to create complex templates without using external tools or custom resources | AWS CDK apps can be more complex and difficult to debug than traditional YAML or JSON templates         | Lacks some of the high-level abstractions provided by other infrastructure as code tools                              |
|                | YAML syntax can be verbose and difficult to read and maintain for large and complex templates | Requires installing and configuring AWS CDK before use                                                  | Updates can sometimes break existing infrastructure, requiring careful management and testing before applying changes |
|                | Can be challenging to manage dependencies between resources                                   | Debugging and troubleshooting can be more difficult than YAML or JSON templates                         | Can be difficult to create reusable templates and share code between multiple Terraform configurations                |

| **Issues that can Appear** | Limited support for non-AWS resources, can be difficult to create complex templates without using external tools or custom resources, YAML syntax can be verbose and difficult to read and maintain for large and complex templates, can be challenging to manage dependencies between resources in large templates, AWS CloudFormation can be slow to create, update | Requires some knowledge of AWS constructs and services, can be challenging to manage dependencies between resources in large templates, TypeScript and other programming languages supported by AWS CDK may not be familiar to all users, can be difficult to integrate with other third-party tools or services | Steep learning curve, especially for users new to infrastructure as code, can be challenging to create complex templates, may require external tools or services for certain advanced features and functionalities, some users may find the HCL syntax challenging to learn and use, managing state can be challenging in large deployments |
